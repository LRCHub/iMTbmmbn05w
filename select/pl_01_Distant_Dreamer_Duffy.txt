Although you think I cope
my head is filled with hope
of some place other than here
Although you think I smile
inside all the while
I'm wondering
about my destiny
I'm thinking about
all the things
I'd like to do in my life
I'm a dreamer
a distant dreamer
dreaming for hope
from today
Even when you see me frown
my heart won't let me down
because I know there's
better things to come
(Woah Yeah)
And when life gets tough
I feel I've had enough
I hold on to a distant star
I'm thinking about
all the things
I'd like to do in my life
I'm a dreamer
A distant dreamer
dreaming for hope from today
I'm a dreamer
A distant dreamer
dreaming for hope from today
Yeah I'm a dreamer
<♪>
I'm a dreamer
a distant dreamer
dreaming for hope from today
Yeah i'm a dreamer
<♪>
I'm a dreamer
